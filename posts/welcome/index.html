First Things First I’ll be posting here about any and all things related to technology, music, and world events. While I may mention world events and/or the politics surrounding them, I tend to stay away from purely political discussions.

Ghost is a blogging platform built on Node.js. It is open source and hosted on Github. I hope you like it, because I sure do.</p><p>Maybe one day I&rsquo;ll get around to contributing to Ghost - until then, using it will have to suffice. :-)</p><h4 id=hosted-in-the-cloud>Hosted in the Cloud</h4><p>This blog is hosted in the cloud with <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/>Digital Ocean</a>. And yes, I tried other platforms, investigated prices, etc. This was the easiest and cheapest I could find. I&rsquo;m open to suggestions, but <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application>Digital&rsquo;s Ocean&rsquo;s one click deploy of Ghost</a> was hard to beat.</p><h4 id=a-work-in-progress>A Work in Progress</h4><p>I hope to be making a lot of changes to the blog over time. Right now, I&rsquo;m using the default theme called <a href=https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper>Casper</a>. I&rsquo;m going to get around to changing this eventually. Many of themes out there have the ability to use <a href=http://disqus.com/>Disqus</a> comments (or Facebook or Google+ or &mldr;). I&rsquo;d like to add this option here, but I probably won&rsquo;t get to it right away.</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
