tl;dr - Node.js and io.js should merge and the Node Foundation should use the open governance model proven by io.js
The Fork When io.js started I was mostly apathetic about the fork. I thought it could lead to good things but it was too soon to tell.

To quote Eran Hammer&rsquo;s <a href=http://hueniverse.com/2014/12/04/before-the-drama/>post on the subject</a>: &ldquo;Can things get better? Absolutely!&rdquo;</p><p>That was largely my sentiment before the first of the year. As time passed, I started to see how io&rsquo;s governance model gave me a great deal of insight into where they were going and what they wanted to do.</p><h3 id=investment>Investment</h3><p>I&rsquo;m not a contributor to the Node.js core, but I am a heavy user of it. I use it when writing frontend JavaScript with <a href=http://gruntjs.com/>Grunt</a>. I&rsquo;ve built APIs with <a href=http://expressjs.com/>Express</a> and <a href=http://hapijs.com/>Hapi</a>. Recently I started exploring static site generators like <a href=http://hexo.io/>Hexo</a>. Not to mention this blog runs on <a href=https://ghost.org/>Ghost</a> which is of course built on Node. <strong>To say that I am heavily invested in Node would be accurate.</strong></p><p>The existence of the fork makes for plenty of confusion as to what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve probably <a href=http://www.williamjohnbert.com/2015/02/why-id-like-node-and-io-dot-js-to-merge/>felt the pain</a> less than others.</p><h3 id=governance-and-the-way-forward>Governance and the Way Forward</h3><p>So where do Node.js and io.js go from here?</p><p>Joyent <a href=https://www.joyent.com/about/press/joyent-moves-to-establish-nodejs-foundation>recently announced</a> the creation of the Node.js Foundation. This is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done. The two projects need to merge.</p><h4 id=open-governance>Open Governance</h4><p>In the 2 years or so I&rsquo;ve used Node I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had as clear of an idea of where the project was going as in the short time that io.js has been around. This is why I firmly believe that the Node.js foundation should adopt the <a href=https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md>io.js governance model</a>.</p><p>A recent io.js <a href=https://medium.com/@iojs/io-js-and-a-node-js-foundation-4e14699fb7be>blog post</a> hinted that this is a possibility. I hope that the techical committee makes this a reality.</p><h4 id=a-word-of-thanks>A Word of Thanks</h4><p>I was inspired to write this by William Bert&rsquo;s site <a href=http://nodegovernance.io/>nodegovernance.io</a> and <a href=http://www.williamjohnbert.com/2015/02/why-id-like-node-and-io-dot-js-to-merge/>his post</a> on the subject.
