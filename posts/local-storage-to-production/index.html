LocalStorage is Synchronous! Enter localStorage.

I sometimes see apps that are in the prototype phase using local storage as a way to store data. I usually shy away from this method but we recently gave it a shot in an AngularJS project I&rsquo;m working.</p><p>This worked great for a while, until I decided to move to an async API.

It caused ripple effects <em>everywhere</em> because this app used it <em>everywhere</em>.</p><p>There are many <a href=http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/20/step-away-from-the-localstorage/>articles</a> and <a href=http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/03/07/in-defense-of-localstorage/>blogs</a> <a href=http://oscargodson.com/posts/why-localstorage-has-already-failed-us.html>about</a> <a href=http://www.webdirections.org/blog/localstorage-perhaps-not-so-harmful/>this topic</a>.</p><p>There&rsquo;s plenty of information in those links so I leave it up to the reader to form their own opinion of localStorage.</p><h3 id=keep-production-in-mind>Keep Production in Mind</h3><p>It seems to me that the most important part of using localStorage is to keep your end state in mind. What is your app going to do in production?</p><p>As developers, we&rsquo;re often guilty of taking a &ldquo;get it working now&rdquo; mentality. In this case, we took this to heart a bit too much and forgot our end state.</p><p>Personally, I see a few different uses for localStorage. However, there is no place for localStorage when you will later want to replace it with an async call.</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
