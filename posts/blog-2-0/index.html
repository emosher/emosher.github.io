After months of tinkering (and by tinkering, I mean procrastinating) I have finally moved my blog to Hexo! In this post I&rsquo;ll cover some of the differences between my old and new blog as well as some of the reasons why I decided to migrate.</p><h3 id=prior-set-up>Prior Set Up</h3><p>Previously, I was running a blog on <a href=https://ghost.org/>Ghost</a> using <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/>Digital Ocean</a>. And honestly this boiled down to one important thing - the Digital Ocean server was not free. Paying the few bucks a month simply didn&rsquo;t make sense because I wasn&rsquo;t using my blog that much. I definitely hope to change that, but for now I couldn&rsquo;t justify keeping the server.</p><p>I have nothing but good things to say about Ghost and Digital Ocean. Ghost is an awesome piece of software that I continue to watch closely. Digital Ocean&rsquo;s tutorial&rsquo;s alone made me admire the company, but their one click deploy of Ghost made things extremely easy. The decision to move off of Ghost and Digital Ocean was more about the desire for a simpler platform without a server and database.</p><h3 id=move-to-hexo>Move to Hexo</h3><p>The move to Hexo was quite easy. With Ghost&rsquo;s export function I moved all my data out of Ghost and <a href=https://github.com/jasonslyvia/hexo-migrator-ghost>migrated it to Hexo</a>. I&rsquo;m still playing around with some of the settings, so I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;ll make some more changes in the near future. But it was an easy transition, and I&rsquo;m pleased with the result. Hexo is really a breeze to use, deploy and configure. Pair that with the ease of use of <a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a> and you have my new blog.</p><p>There&rsquo;s lots of great writing out there about people that have moved from Ghost to Hexo. For me, this was the right decision.</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
