Thanks to the Ghost documentation and How to Install Ghost, the upgrade process was a breeze.
Features See the Ghost blog for the full list of features.
Ghost 0.5 brings a whole host of new features. A newly refactored admin interface, public JSON API, and multiple user support.
New Release Schedule These new features are great, but what I am most excited about is the new release schedule."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://emosher.dev/css/normalize.css><link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700' rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://emosher.dev/css/cayman.a134bfd387c4421893b8b84f607a0e7f301904bffa11e51ed538af8a40d4c4f3.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><title>Ghost 0.5 | emosher.dev</title></head><body><section class=page-header><h1 class=project-name>Eric&rsquo;s Blog</h1><h2 class=project-tagline>A technologist just trying to navigate through life</h2><nav><a href=/ class=btn>Blog</a>

Instead of releasing 2-3 times a year in large milestones, they are moving to a more continuous release schedule. From the above post by <a href=http://hannah.wf/>Hannah Wolfe</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Starting today, we&rsquo;re moving to a more agile release process. Every 2-4 weeks we&rsquo;re going to ship new features, improvements and bug-fixes to Ghost. There won&rsquo;t be any more big-bang events like this one. There will be smaller, more frequent announcements that we&rsquo;ve released new features, fixes and improvements.</p></blockquote><p>What appeals to me most about this is that I can choose to upgrade when they release a feature that I really want. Instead of waiting months for a single feature, I can look for the specific timeframe they intend on delivering that feature.</p><p>I hope this new schedule works out for them and I&rsquo;m happy to see them make this change!</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
