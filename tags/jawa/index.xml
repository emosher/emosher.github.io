The steps are there to show some of the features of Angular, and how an application might progress through development.
When I was learning Angular (around 1.0), what I found to be the most lacking was practical examples. I hope it helps those that are learning the &amp;ldquo;Angular way.&amp;rdquo;
Jawa The application renders information about open source projects, links to the project Github page, and renders the project&amp;rsquo;s Readme document in the browser.</description></item></channel></rss>
