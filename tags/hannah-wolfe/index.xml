Thanks to the Ghost documentation and How to Install Ghost, the upgrade process was a breeze.
Features See the Ghost blog for the full list of features.
Ghost 0.5 brings a whole host of new features. A newly refactored admin interface, public JSON API, and multiple user support.
New Release Schedule These new features are great, but what I am most excited about is the new release schedule.</description></item></channel></rss>
