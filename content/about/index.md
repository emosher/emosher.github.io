This is my **personal blog.**

### About Me

I am a dad and husband first.  I work for [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) as a [Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) Solutions Engineer.  There I help people adopt Kubernetes, and modernize their applications.

Any opinions posted here are my own and do not represent a position of my employer.

At home, I do a lot of things for fun.  In a way, my hobby is collecting hobbies.  I'm into music, making things out of wood and leather, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, grilling, and occassionally home brewing.
