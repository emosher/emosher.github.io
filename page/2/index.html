<p>If you are not familiar with AngularJS or directives, head over to the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial" target="_blank" rel="external">AngularJS tutorial</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide" target="_blank" rel="external">developer guide</a> to get up to speed.</p>
<h3 id="Template-vs-TemplateUrl"><a href="#Template-vs-TemplateUrl" class="headerlink" title="Template vs. TemplateUrl"></a>Template vs. TemplateUrl</h3><p>If you are like me, you like to keep HTML out of your JavaScript. When I’m writing my directives, I almost always keep templates in seperate HTML files rather than using inline templates (see below for an example).<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"> // This inline template makes me a sad panda :(</span><br><span class="line">  angular.module(&apos;myApp&apos;, [])</span><br><span class="line">  	.directive(&apos;example&apos;, function() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  		return &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      		template: &apos;&lt;div ng-include=&quot;contentUrl&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&apos;</span><br><span class="line">      		&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">  		&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Or …<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"> // Moving that HTML into a seperate file makes me happy! :)</span><br><span class="line">  angular.module(&apos;myApp&apos;, [])</span><br><span class="line">  	.directive(&apos;example&apos;, function() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  		return &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      		templateUrl: &apos;example.html&apos;</span><br><span class="line">      		&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">  		&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<h3 id="‘Smart’-Directives"><a href="#‘Smart’-Directives" class="headerlink" title="‘Smart’ Directives"></a>‘Smart’ Directives</h3><p>One of the big challenges I have been facing is how to make my directives <em>smarter.</em> One way I have found recently is creating the ability to include one of any number of templates via the <code>ngInclude</code> directive above. This way one directive can use any number of templates which makes the directive feel like a self-contained component.</p>
<p>Thanks to the built-in ngInclude directive, this is fairly easy. Throw some HTML into <code>one.html</code> or <code>two.html</code> and you will have the start to a smarter directive. Suppose you have the following in your directive’s <code>templateUrl: mydirective.html</code>.<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">	&lt;div ng-include=&quot;contentUrl&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span><br><span class="line">```    </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">This allows you to set the directive&apos;s scope variable `contentUrl` to be included within this directive. For demonstration, the directive will be called `emSmarty` and you would structure it like so:</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<pre><code>app.directive(&apos;emSmarty&apos;, function() {
    return {
        templateUrl: &apos;emsmarty.html&apos;,
        scope: true,
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
            scope.contentUrl = attrs.emSmarty + &apos;.html&apos;;
        }
    };
});
</code></pre><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">This allows you to use the directive within your HTML: `em-smarty=&quot;one&quot;`. That will include `one.html` in the directive!</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">### Feel the Power of the Directive Side</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Where ngInclude comes in very handy is where you have several templates that you might want to load depending on some condition. Think of it like this...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<pre><code>switch (condition) {
    case &quot;one&quot;:
        // Use template &apos;one&apos;
        break;
    case &quot;two&quot;:
        // Use template &apos;two&apos;
        break;
    case &quot;three&quot;:
        // Use template &apos;three&apos;
        break;
    // This could go on...
}
</code></pre><p>```</p>
<p>Here’s a Plunker I created to show a simple example of conditional loading a templateUrl.</p>

<p>When I was learning Angular (around 1.0), what I found to be the most lacking was practical examples. I hope it helps those that are learning the “Angular way.”</p>
<h3 id="Jawa"><a href="#Jawa" class="headerlink" title="Jawa"></a>Jawa</h3><p>The application renders information about open source projects, links to the project Github page, and renders the project’s Readme document in the browser. </p>
<p>For demonstration purposes, the project data is kept in a JSON file. In a non-example application, you would write an Angular service to connect to a backend. Maybe I will get around to writing a quick Node/Express backend for it - but I make no promises (see the todo list). :-)</p>
<p>To see a demo of the app during the steps of development, see <a href="http://emosher.github.io/jawa/" target="_blank" rel="external">the Github Pages site</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/emosher/jawa" target="_blank" rel="external">Github repo</a> shows the steps of building the application.</p>

<p>But it got me thinking … what if I had 3 months to work on whatever code I wanted to?</p>
<h3 id="What-am-I-truly-passionate-about"><a href="#What-am-I-truly-passionate-about" class="headerlink" title="What am I truly passionate about?"></a>What am I truly passionate about?</h3><p>If I had 3 months to code anything I wanted what would that be?</p>
<p>I think it might fall into several categories and knowing myself, it would probably involve a little bit of each area.</p>
<h4 id="Fractals"><a href="#Fractals" class="headerlink" title="Fractals"></a>Fractals</h4><p>I’ve been interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal" target="_blank" rel="external">Fractals</a> for almost as long as I’ve been coding. I was fortunate enough to take a short class on fractals during college. That really opened my eyes to what applied mathematics could do.</p>
<p>If I had some dedicated time to work on fractals, I might do some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a library or two to handle the creation of fractals</li>
<li>Investigate some ways to apply fractals to web apps &amp; sites (backgrounds, borders, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Web-Tech"><a href="#Web-Tech" class="headerlink" title="Web Tech"></a>Web Tech</h4><p>I’m of the school of thought that the web is where everything is going. I’ve been a big fan of various web technologies for a while now. </p>
<p>If I had more time, I would really dig into some of the frameworks and libraries that I commonly use in order to understand what makes them tick. Once I had a better grasp on some of the internals, I would look to contribute where appropriate. Some of these are (in no particular order): </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">AngularJS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Express</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grunt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Yeoman</a></li>
<li><a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Socket IO</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are certainly others but these are perfect examples of things that I have used a lot, but not had a chance to dig enough into how they work.</p>
<h4 id="Music"><a href="#Music" class="headerlink" title="Music"></a>Music</h4><p>Before I got into coding, I was into music. I still am in fact. Whenever possible, I like to blend music and software together. </p>
<p>If I had the 3 months to code, as I mentioned above, I might look to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create some “songs” based on programming patterns</li>
<li>Dig into some music related software, which I have not had the chance to use such as <a href="https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js" target="_blank" rel="external">Midi.js</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Stay-Classy-Stay-Passionate"><a href="#Stay-Classy-Stay-Passionate" class="headerlink" title="Stay Classy, Stay Passionate"></a>Stay Classy, Stay Passionate</h3><p>Whatever you do, be sure to take some time to remember what you are truly passionate about. I’ve only scratched the surface of what truly speaks to me, but that is the point. Taking the time to think about your real interests is an invaluable investment in your future. </p>
<p>I’m glad I found <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hacker School</a> because someday I think I might want to go there. However, in the mean time it was a great lesson to think about what I might do if I could focus solely on code for 3 months.</p>

<p>That dichotomy is something that I have seen for as long as I have been involved with technology. I see lots of brilliant people that can talk theories, concepts, and patterns all day long. When it comes to building useful working applications, that is not their strong suit.</p>
<h5 id="Before-we-go-further…"><a href="#Before-we-go-further…" class="headerlink" title="Before we go further…"></a>Before we go further…</h5><p>As much as the preceeding statements may seem inflammatory, that’s not the intent. The way I see it - there is merit to both Computer Science and Software Engineering. It seems to me though, that it is <strong>how</strong> these things are used that is most useful. There are merits to both Computer Science and Software Engineering, however I believe these are two distinct fields that should not be confused.</p>
<h3 id="Computer-Science"><a href="#Computer-Science" class="headerlink" title="Computer Science"></a>Computer Science</h3><p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank" rel="external">Wikipedia’s definition</a> Computer Science is defined as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer Science (abbreviated CS or CompSci) is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical processes (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information, whether such information is encoded as bits in a computer memory or transcribed engines and protein structures in a human cell. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope that you see the theme here. “Theory” and “design” are what I see as Computer Science. These things are important! However, they are not the same thing as <strong>implementation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Software-Engineering"><a href="#Software-Engineering" class="headerlink" title="Software Engineering"></a>Software Engineering</h3><p>Wikipedia’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering" target="_blank" rel="external">Software Engineering article</a> is much less satisfying. </p>
<p>What I believe to be the value of Software Engineering is the <strong>practice</strong> of creating software. This is something that is an extension of, but different from Computer Science.</p>
<p>There is a need for theory. There is a need for design. <strong>Yes, absolutely!</strong> I believe that given the plethora of terms associated with “technologists,” there is a need for some separation and distinction of terminology. </p>
<p>There should be a clean separation of these terms, and theory vs. implementation seems like the cleanest distinction. </p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Computer Scientists are the architects. They create conceptual designs of what something might look like. They may create low level experiments and algorithms from time to time, but design is their strong suit.</p>
<p>Software Engineers are the people that build what the architects have designed. They take concepts and turn them into something useful. These are the people that don’t always care how every little piece works, but they are able to pull together pieces to create a <em>useful tool</em>.</p>
<p>I believe that today I am a better Software Engineer than Computer Scientist. I’m much better at creating things than giving all of the concepts of what is going on within an application. </p>
<p>I also believe that some of the best “technologists” are people that can perform both Computer Scientist and Software Engineer roles. The ability to architect <em>and</em> implement is indispensible. I can do some basic architecting, but I have a ways to go. Until then, I will continue building useful tools. :)</p>

While I may mention world events and/or the politics surrounding them, I tend to stay away from purely political discussions. Sure, I have opinions but I’ll leave the politicking to the politicians.</p>
<p>I created this blog because there are a lot of things I like to talk about and this seems like a good way to do that. I welcome discussion and/or criticism.</p>

And yes, I tried other platforms, investigated prices, etc. This was the easiest and cheapest I could find. I’m open to suggestions, but <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application" target="_blank" rel="external">Digital’s Ocean’s one click deploy of Ghost</a> was hard to beat.</p>
