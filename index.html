After months of tinkering (and by tinkering, I mean procrastinating) I have finally moved my blog to Hexo! In this post I’ll cover some of the differences between my old and new blog as well as some of the reasons why I decided to migrate.  </p>
<h3 id="Prior-Set-Up"><a href="#Prior-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="Prior Set Up"></a>Prior Set Up</h3><p>Previously, I was running a blog on <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ghost</a> using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Digital Ocean</a>. And honestly this boiled down to one important thing - the Digital Ocean server was not free. Paying the few bucks a month simply didn’t make sense because I wasn’t using my blog that much. I definitely hope to change that, but for now I couldn’t justify keeping the server.</p>
<p>I have nothing but good things to say about Ghost and Digital Ocean. Ghost is an awesome piece of software that I continue to watch closely. Digital Ocean’s tutorial’s alone made me admire the company, but their one click deploy of Ghost made things extremely easy. The decision to move off of Ghost and Digital Ocean was more about the desire for a simpler platform without a server and database.</p>
<h3 id="Move-to-Hexo"><a href="#Move-to-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Move to Hexo"></a>Move to Hexo</h3><p>The move to Hexo was quite easy. With Ghost’s export function I moved all my data out of Ghost and <a href="https://github.com/jasonslyvia/hexo-migrator-ghost" target="_blank" rel="external">migrated it to Hexo</a>. I’m still playing around with some of the settings, so I’m sure that I’ll make some more changes in the near future. But it was an easy transition, and I’m pleased with the result. Hexo is really a breeze to use, deploy and configure. Pair that with the ease of use of <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Github Pages</a> and you have my new blog.</p>
<p>There’s lots of great writing out there about people that have moved from Ghost to Hexo. For me, this was the right decision.</p>

- node.js</a></span></p></div><div class="post-content"><p>I’m going to take a minute to comment on the <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Node.js</a> fork known as <a href="https://iojs.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">io.js</a>. </p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - Node.js and io.js should merge and the Node Foundation should use the <a href="https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md" target="_blank" rel="external">open governance model</a> proven by io.js</p>
<h3 id="The-Fork"><a href="#The-Fork" class="headerlink" title="The Fork"></a>The Fork</h3><p>When io.js started I was mostly apathetic about the fork. I thought it <em>could</em> lead to good things but it was too soon to tell. To quote Eran Hammer’s <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2014/12/04/before-the-drama/" target="_blank" rel="external">post on the subject</a>: “Can things get better? Absolutely!”</p>
<p>That was largely my sentiment before the first of the year. As time passed, I started to see how io’s governance model gave me a great deal of insight into where they were going and what they wanted to do.</p>
<h3 id="Investment"><a href="#Investment" class="headerlink" title="Investment"></a>Investment</h3><p>I’m not a contributor to the Node.js core, but I am a heavy user of it. I use it when writing frontend JavaScript with <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grunt</a>. I’ve built APIs with <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Express</a> and <a href="http://hapijs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hapi</a>. Recently I started exploring static site generators like <a href="http://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a>. Not to mention this blog runs on <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ghost</a> which is of course built on Node. <strong>To say that I am heavily invested in Node would be accurate.</strong></p>
<p>The existence of the fork makes for plenty of confusion as to what works and what doesn’t. I’ve probably <a href="http://www.williamjohnbert.com/2015/02/why-id-like-node-and-io-dot-js-to-merge/" target="_blank" rel="external">felt the pain</a> less than others.</p>
<h3 id="Governance-and-the-Way-Forward"><a href="#Governance-and-the-Way-Forward" class="headerlink" title="Governance and the Way Forward"></a>Governance and the Way Forward</h3><p>So where do Node.js and io.js go from here?</p>
<p>Joyent <a href="https://www.joyent.com/about/press/joyent-moves-to-establish-nodejs-foundation" target="_blank" rel="external">recently announced</a> the creation of the Node.js Foundation. This is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done. The two projects need to merge.</p>
<h4 id="Open-Governance"><a href="#Open-Governance" class="headerlink" title="Open Governance"></a>Open Governance</h4><p>In the 2 years or so I’ve used Node I don’t think I’ve ever had as clear of an idea of where the project was going as in the short time that io.js has been around. This is why I firmly believe that the Node.js foundation should adopt the <a href="https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md" target="_blank" rel="external">io.js governance model</a>.</p>
<p>A recent io.js <a href="https://medium.com/@iojs/io-js-and-a-node-js-foundation-4e14699fb7be" target="_blank" rel="external">blog post</a> hinted that this is a possibility. I hope that the techical committee makes this a reality.</p>
<h4 id="A-Word-of-Thanks"><a href="#A-Word-of-Thanks" class="headerlink" title="A Word of Thanks"></a>A Word of Thanks</h4><p>I was inspired to write this by William Bert’s site <a href="http://nodegovernance.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">nodegovernance.io</a> and <a href="http://www.williamjohnbert.com/2015/02/why-id-like-node-and-io-dot-js-to-merge/" target="_blank" rel="external">his post</a> on the subject. A big thank you to him and the rest of the Node.js/io.js community. </p>

Every once in a while, I encounter something that causes major ripple effects within my frontend code.</p>
<p>What I encountered recently was the difference between synchronous and asynchronous. While the difference is often obvious, it can be easy to overlook. </p>
<h3 id="LocalStorage-is-Synchronous"><a href="#LocalStorage-is-Synchronous" class="headerlink" title="LocalStorage is Synchronous!"></a>LocalStorage is Synchronous!</h3><p>Enter localStorage. I sometimes see apps that are in the prototype phase using local storage as a way to store data. I usually shy away from this method but we recently gave it a shot in an AngularJS project I’m working.</p>
<p>This worked great for a while, until I decided to move to an async API. I then realized that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20231163/is-html5-localstorage-asynchronous" target="_blank" rel="external">local storage is synchronous</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Refactors-Abound"><a href="#Refactors-Abound" class="headerlink" title="Refactors Abound"></a>Refactors Abound</h3><p>This realization resulted in a massive refactor. It caused ripple effects <em>everywhere</em> because this app used it <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>There are many <a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/20/step-away-from-the-localstorage/" target="_blank" rel="external">articles</a> and <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/03/07/in-defense-of-localstorage/" target="_blank" rel="external">blogs</a> <a href="http://oscargodson.com/posts/why-localstorage-has-already-failed-us.html" target="_blank" rel="external">about</a> <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/blog/localstorage-perhaps-not-so-harmful/" target="_blank" rel="external">this topic</a>.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of information in those links so I leave it up to the reader to form their own opinion of localStorage.</p>
<h3 id="Keep-Production-in-Mind"><a href="#Keep-Production-in-Mind" class="headerlink" title="Keep Production in Mind"></a>Keep Production in Mind</h3><p>It seems to me that the most important part of using localStorage is to keep your end state in mind. What is your app going to do in production?</p>
<p>As developers, we’re often guilty of taking a “get it working now” mentality. In this case, we took this to heart a bit too much and forgot our end state.</p>
<p>Personally, I see a few different uses for localStorage. However, there is no place for localStorage when you will later want to replace it with an async call.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Ghost <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-5/" target="_blank" rel="external">documentation</a> and <a href="http://www.howtoinstallghost.com/how-to-update-ghost/" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Install Ghost</a>, the upgrade process was a breeze.</p>
<h3 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h3><p>See the Ghost <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-5/" target="_blank" rel="external">blog</a> for the full list of features.</p>
<p>Ghost 0.5 brings a whole host of new features. A newly refactored admin interface, public JSON API, and multiple user support.</p>
<h3 id="New-Release-Schedule"><a href="#New-Release-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="New Release Schedule"></a>New Release Schedule</h3><p>These new features are great, but what I am most excited about is the new release schedule. Instead of releasing 2-3 times a year in large milestones, they are moving to a more continuous release schedule. From the above post by <a href="http://hannah.wf/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hannah Wolfe</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting today, we’re moving to a more agile release process. Every 2-4 weeks we’re going to ship new features, improvements and bug-fixes to Ghost. There won’t be any more big-bang events like this one. There will be smaller, more frequent announcements that we’ve released new features, fixes and improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What appeals to me most about this is that I can choose to upgrade when they release a feature that I really want. Instead of waiting months for a single feature, I can look for the specific timeframe they intend on delivering that feature.</p>
<p>I hope this new schedule works out for them and I’m happy to see them make this change!</p>

- directives</a></span></p></div><div class="post-content"><p>My <a href="https://emosher.org/2014/05/19/building-smarter-directives/" target="_blank" rel="external">last post</a> talked about conditionally loading templates using <code>ng-include</code>. </p>
<p>I spent a good amount of time using this, but found it to be problematic because it was causing my HTML to become bloated. Instead of adding to the div soup, I set out to find a better way.</p>
<p>This leads to nested divs:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;div ng-include=&quot;contentUrl&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Renders something like this:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;div ng-include=&quot;contentUrl&quot;&gt;</span><br><span class="line">    &lt;div&gt; This is the template &lt;/div&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/div&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>As it turned out, there are options! First, I found out that in 1.1.4, Angular added the ability to use a function as the <code>templateUrl</code>. In your directive definition object, you can have the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">angular.module(<span class="string">'myApp'</span>, [])</span><br><span class="line">    .directive(<span class="string">'example'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    	<span class="keyword">return</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        	templateUrl: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">tElement, tAttrs</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">                <span class="comment">// Template can be chosen here</span></span><br><span class="line">                <span class="comment">// Try something like this</span></span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">return</span> tAttrs.example.toLowerCase() + <span class="string">'.html'</span>;</span><br><span class="line">			&#125;</span><br><span class="line">		&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Then use it like this: </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;!-- Includes &apos;one.html&apos; --&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;div example=&quot;one&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;!-- Includes &apos;two.html&apos; --&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;div example=&quot;two&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The other option that I found was to do what is essentially a manual <code>ng-include</code>. The problem I’ve found with this is that it makes the directive a bit harder to test. By going around Angular’s built in ways of including the template, you are circumventing the  <code>$templateCache</code>.</p>
<p>To do this, you use the <code>$http</code> and <code>$compile</code> service to retrieve and compile the template yourself:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">angular.module(<span class="string">'myApp'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .directive(<span class="string">'example'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">$http, $compile</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    	<span class="keyword">return</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        	link: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">scope, element, attrs</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        		$http.get(attrs.example + <span class="string">'.html'</span>).then(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">response</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">                	element.html($compile(response.data)(scope));</span><br><span class="line">                &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">            &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This version of the directive would be used the same as above, allowing you to include <code>one.html</code> or <code>two.html</code>.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide to use, the good news is that you have options to suit your situation.</p>
